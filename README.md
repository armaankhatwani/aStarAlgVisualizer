## aStarAlgVisualizer
Python implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm, designed to find the shortest path between two points on a grid while avoiding obstacles. There is an interactive interface to create barriers and set start/end points, all to visualize the search process of the A* algorithm.

### Usage
- Left Click: Place start point, end point, or create barriers on the grid.
- Right Click: Remove obstacles or reset start and end points.
- Spacebar: Initiate the search for the shortest path.
- Key 'c': Clear the grid and reset start and end points.

### Requirements
- Python
- Pygame
- Tkinter

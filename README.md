# aStarAlgVisualizer

Python implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm, designed to find the shortest path between two points on a grid while avoiding obstacles. The algorithm is visualized using the Pygame library, providing an interactive interface to create barriers, set start and end points, and visualize the search process.

Usage
Left Click: Place start point, end point, or create barriers on the grid.
Right Click: Remove obstacles or reset start and end points.
Spacebar: Initiate the search for the shortest path.
Key 'c': Clear the grid and reset start and end points.

Requirements
Python
Pygame
Tkinter
